# How to add a project

1.) Go to `public/projects`
2.) Add a new project to `settings.json` (take note of `{id}`)
3.) Create a new directory named `{id}` within `public/projects`
4.) Add a `{id}.jpg` for the thumbnail (square image recommended)
5.) Create a `{id}.md` for the page itself
6.) Add any image sources in the same directory
